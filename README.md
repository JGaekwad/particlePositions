# particlePositions
Short code for creating an evenly spaced of seed particle positions for CFD particle tracking

This code was used with icoUncoupledKinematicParcelFoam and OpenFoam7 to model wind driven rain.

It outputs both a lsit of points (x,y,z) and those points formatted as vectors for insertion into the particle locations file.
